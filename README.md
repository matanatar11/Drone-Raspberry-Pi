LTE datalink drone project
Pixhawk + Raspberry Pi + LTE(4G) network drone development
It is the source code of the Raspberry Pi files.

Tested on Hardwares/Components
Body: Custom Multirotor
FC: PixRacer R15
Onboard computer: Raspberry Pi Zero
Network: HUAWEI E3372 / HUAWEI E3370 (3G/4G)
Support Firmware
Firmware: PX4 1.11.0
Features
Connect Pixhawk and Raspberry Pi using mavlink-router and pymavlink
Raspberry Pi send mavlink data to ground station through UDP;
Raspberry Pi read mavlink GPS data and submit the drone position to glympse through glympse API in real-time;
Raspberry Pi camera send video streaming to ground station;
The pilot can use radio control to switch on/off the video streaming;
Source Files in /home/pi/
files in	descriptions
glympse/glympse.py	Send drone's GPS position to Glympse
mavlink-router-service/mavlink-router.sh	Routing mavlink from FC to GCS
jpeg-stream/sender2.py	Sending low bandwidth, low latency video stream
jpeg-stream/receiver2.py	Receiving and playback the stream video (moved to https://github.com/rc-bellergy/groundstation)
jpeg-stream/control2.py	Use remote control to start, stop, recording video
offboard/rtl-altitude.py	Adjust RTL altitude based on the max elevation on the RTL path (under development)
The enabled system services, in case you need to restart it
sudo systemctl restart mavlink-router
sudo systemctl restart jpeg-sender
sudo systemctl restart wvdial
Check mavlink-router service log
sudo journalctl -u mavlink-router
Convert h264 to mp4
The sender2.py will record video on .h264 format. You need MP4Box to convert it to mp4 format

/usr/bin/MP4Box -add test.h264 test.mp4 -flat
